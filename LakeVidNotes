Blob storage optimiized for unstructured (vids, pics etc)

ADLS Gen 2 no file size limit

Posix ACLs in ADLS gen 1

....

Data Lake Gen 2 - blob and ADLS 1 combined

AzCopy for backup and recovery! 

Parquet - supports predicate pushdown

Slower writes for Orc and Parquet

Avro has faster writes... or json or csv.

Zones
-----------
archive, raw, reference, curated, temp, stage

subsystems under raw for where come from...
users in experimental area as subsystems...

good file naming convention with descriptives and times (e.g. my avro file format)

avoid empty folders and files or mixing file types within a folder hierarchy

raw zone - use update date
curated zone - use created date/business date

raw = inbound/ingest...assumes incremental load
never remove this data
raw = ods

curated - analytic zone. enriched, transformed

staging or dwh? zone. 

need a data catalog!
don't have small files. so roll up the avro into large chunks!
optimal file size, 64mb, 256mb...
each compute engine you want to change settings.

good metadata to add to curated stuff...
createddate, processeddate, md5hash of the file, source 

reference zone...?? 

really really need to sort azure data catalog!!

use curated for data warehouse dwh/dim
				dwh/fact
so bin model folder. 
make sure add a function to be able to read the raw lake
but can read and write in cooked.
